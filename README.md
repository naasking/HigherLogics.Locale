# HigherLogics.Locale

This project is intended to provide some general business functionality, like:

 * mailing address parsing and validation
 * a currency-typed Money abstraction

The current project name is preliminary and will not reflect the final name
or organization of these abstractions.

# Future Work

 * make country, currency, continents, and their associations dynamically loaded
   so we don't need to rebuild for any changes
 * Fixed\<T\> should reference HigherLogics.Algebra
 * extensions for mailing address validation to verify it via an online source?
